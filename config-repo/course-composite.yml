    get-composite-course:
      description: Returns a course view of the specified course id
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        If the requested course id is found the method will return information regarding:
        1. Course information
        1. Ratings
        1. Lectures
        1. Service Addresses
        (technical information regarding the addresses of the microservices that created the response)
        # Expected partial and error responses
        1. If no course information is found, a <b>404 - Not Found</b> error will be returned
        1. In no lectures or ratings are found for a course, a partial response will be returned

    create-composite-course:
      description: Creates a composite course
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        The composite product information posted to the API will be splitted up and stored as separate course-info, lecture and rating entities.
        # Expected error responses
        1. If a course with the same courseId as specified in the posted information already exists,
           an <b>422 - Unprocessable Entity</b> error with a "duplicate key" error message will be returned
    delete-composite-course:
      description: Deletes a course composite
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        Entities for course information, lectures and ratings related to the specificed courseId will be deleted.
        The implementation of the delete method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called several times with the same response.
        This means that a delete request of a non existing course will return <b>200 Ok</b>.
